# SUPER PLAN — full Divinum Officium replica in WASM

The end state for this repo: a **byte-for-byte replica of the
DivinumOfficium.com Perl site**, served as a fully static GitHub Pages
deploy backed by a single WebAssembly bundle. Every render must come
from a pure function over an embedded, postcard+brotli compressed
data corpus — zero hardcoded Latin in JS or Rust, zero CGI, zero
Perl at runtime.

Three legs reach that end state. **Each leg has its own loop step** —
when a wakeup ping fires the `/loop` skill, the rule below picks the
next active leg.

```
   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │                                                            │
   │   B — Breviary port + deploy                               │
   │   C — Correctness shake-down (the 5 documented patterns)   │
   │   K — Compression / bundle-size finish-line                │
   │                                                            │
   │   Plus the cross-cutting hardcode-audit refactors R2…R5    │
   │   (these unblock C and shrink the bundle for K).           │
   │                                                            │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

All three converge on the same demo deploy at
<https://fschutt.github.io/officium-rs/>. When B / C / K are all
green, the super-plan is done — the URL serves the same calendar +
Mass + Breviary as the upstream Perl site, in 100 % parity, in
≤ 1 MB of WASM, off a static bucket.

## Status board

| Leg | Phase | Status | Owner | Wakeup-cue |
|-----|-------|--------|-------|------------|
| **R** (hardcode audit refactor) | R1 — Mass Ordinary in JS → Ordo.txt walker | ✅ DONE 2026-05-04 (commit `426599d`) | — | — |

Source-of-truth: `webdia.pl:651-682`. Architecture: scrub at Rust render boundary, JSON corpus stays a faithful transcode | — | — |

| R | R3 — Hardcoded date branches (Jan-12 etc.) → Sunday-letter table | ⏳ pending | — | C-leg unblocker |
| R | R4 — Inline-conditional grammar tables | ⏳ pending | — | C-leg unblocker |
| R | R5 — `RankKind` from numerics | ⏳ pending | — | low-priority polish |
| **B** (Breviary) | B1 — Build pipeline (psalms, horas, ordinarium → JSON) | ✅ DONE 2026-05-04 (commit `b2d227c`) — 1,204 horas keys + 202 psalms; src/horas.rs loader + 4 tests passing | — | — |

| B | B5 — Matins (the densest hour) | ✅ DONE 2026-05-05 — Invitatorium splice + multi-Lectio emission (Lectio1..9 with intervening Responsories) via `splice_matins_lectios`; 3 new tests; Lectio4 (Monica proper) + Invitatorium antiphon both verified | — | — |
| B | B6 — Concurrence + first-vespers split | ✅ DONE 2026-05-05 — 4 slices: Te Deum (`a653808`), `[Rule] 3 lectiones` (`20c350b`), nocturn-antiphon grouping (`f58dbcd`), first-vespers concurrence helpers (`parse_horas_rank` + `first_vespers_day_key` — caller-driven rank compare so the walker stays a pure projection). 9 new tests across the 4 slices | — | — |

## Loop rule

When the `/loop` wakeup fires:

1. Read this file. Pick the **first row** with status `⏳ next` or `⏳ pending`
   whose dependencies are all `✅ DONE`. That's the active task.
2. Work on it for one wakeup-window (≤ 30-60 min of work; finite chunks
   only — no open-ended exploration).
3. At end of window, update the row's **Status** to `🟡 in progress
   (commit X)` if not finished, or `✅ DONE (commit X)` if shipped.
4. Commit. Push. Schedule the next wakeup.

Picking precedence when multiple rows are eligible:
- Active leg-B unless blocked. (Breviary is the longest critical path.)
- Switch to leg-C when leg-B is paused waiting on something else.
- Switch to leg-K only when both B and C are blocked or when bundle
  budget breaks (>1 MB).
- Switch to leg-R refactors only when explicitly unblocking a B/C task.

## Hard exit criteria (when this plan is done)

1. **Breviary parity**: ≥ 99.7 % output match against upstream Perl
   for all 8 hours × 5 rubrics × ±50 years (3.4 M cells).
2. **Mass parity**: ≥ 99.95 % across the same 100-year sweep
   (currently 99.86 %; the 5 documented patterns close it).
3. **Calendar parity**: 100 % match for `winner / commemoratio /
   color / season / rank` for all 5 rubrics × 100 years.
4. **Bundle**: ≤ 1 MB raw / ≤ 700 KB brotli for the WASM .wasm; demo
   site under 1.2 MB total payload.
5. **No hardcode**: zero hardcoded Latin in `demo/`; the 5 categories
   from `HARDCODE_AUDIT.md` (A–E) are all marked DONE; an LLM-driven
   audit confirms no per-rubric `match` arms remain that could be
   data-table lookups.
6. **Demo lives at `https://fschutt.github.io/officium-rs/`** with
   three-page nav (Mass / Breviary / Calendar), all rubrics
   selectable, all 8 hours renderable. Identical-text comparison
   against the Perl site for 12 spot-check dates passes.
7. **CI**: three green badges (mass / breviary / calendar regression)
   on the README. The local `scripts/regression.sh` runner can do
   `day | week | year | decade | century` against any rubric.

## Working notes feeding into the plan

- `docs/REGRESSION_RESULTS.md`: the 5 fail patterns (Sancti/01-12,
  Tempora/Pasc1-0t, Commune/C10b, Sancti/02-23o, Sancti/05-04) drive
  leg-C entirely.
- `docs/BREVIARY_PORT_SCOPE.md`: 7-stage breakdown for leg-B; ~11k
  Rust LOC budgeted, ~16 wk human-time. We compress that into a
  staged-incremental-deploy approach: ship Vespers first, expand
  outward.
- `docs/COMPRESSION_BENCH.md`: postcard+brotli decision is settled;
  leg-K is about applying the same to the Breviary corpus and
  exploring shared-dictionary tactics.
- `docs/UPSTREAM_WEIRDNESSES.md`: 36 documented anomalies; leg-C will
  add Breviary entries (as `UPSTREAM_WEIRDNESSES_BREVIARY.md`).
- `docs/HARDCODE_AUDIT.md`: phases R1 done, R2–R5 are interleaved
  with leg-C as fixes turn into refactors.

## Definition of "active task"

The row currently being worked. Only one across all legs at a time
(this is a single-threaded loop). When we wake up:

```
ACTIVE LEG:    B
ACTIVE TASK:   B7 (slice b) — `demo/breviary.html` page
ESTIMATED:     1-2 loop windows. Slice a ✅ shipped (WASM API).
               Remaining:
                 (b) Build `demo/breviary.html` — thin shell
                     mirroring `index.html` but for the 8 hours.
                     Hour selector + date picker; loads WASM
                     and walks the rendered `lines[]` into HTML.
                     Reuse `demo/render.js` patterns; the
                     line-shape (`{k, body, label, role,
                     level, name}`) is identical to
                     `compute_mass_full`'s `ordinary` field.
                 (c) Add `breviary.html` to the navigation in
                     `demo/index.html` and the Calendar page
                     so the three-page nav lands.
EXIT WHEN:     Browsing to `/breviary.html?date=2026-05-04&
               hour=Vespera` renders the Vespera of St. Monica
               with the proper Oratio body visible. Pages CI
               passes.
```

Update this block on every wakeup so the next iteration knows what
was in flight.
